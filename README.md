# MMME-Most-Mediocre-Maze-Ever

Made a simple maze game with simple graphics using pygame

Objective: get yellow square (the player) to the end of the maze (green square)

Tried to implement "npc" that tried to catch the player, but after some failed attempts (difficulties in trying to follow player without wall clipping, etc) decided to go with a timed play, in which after a set ammount of time, it's asked for the player to try again.
Improvements could be made, and the inicial goal wasn't achieved, but it served as a learning experience.
